BarberX is a simple, in-progress web platform for managing appointments and showcasing services for a local barbershop.

## ✂️ Main Features

### 1. 🗓️ Appointment Booking  
Visitors can reserve their spot online through an interactive booking form. This helps avoid waiting in person and improves time management for both customers and staff.

### 2. 📢 Service Highlights and Offers  
The homepage includes sections to announce promotions, new services, or seasonal offers. This helps build engagement and keeps clients informed about what’s new.

### 3. 📱 SMS Notifications via Twilio (Coming Soon)  
The platform is being developed to use **Twilio** for sending SMS notifications to customers after they book an appointment. These messages will:
- Confirm their booking.
- Remind them of their scheduled time.
- Notify them of any changes or promotions.

## 🚧 Status

This website is **currently under development**. While the core structure and booking form are active, additional features such as full responsiveness, admin dashboards, and full Twilio integration are still in progress.

I am still learning web development, and this project is part of my personal learning journey as well as a real solution for managing my own barbershop operations.
